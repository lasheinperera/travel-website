            <h1 id="aboutus">ABOUT US</h1>
            <p>The blue waters of our resident landscape have served as an inspiration to many. Be it as a calming escape, a lively respite, or an unexplored world, the sea is not only an integral element of Sri Lanka's enchantment, but also of our home filled with coastal charms that extend an invitation to you.    
                Born out of the historic splendour of Jetwing Seashells from 1978, our home has since grown into a symbol of modern elegance among Sri Lankan beach resorts. The enchantment of this nostalgic coastline has stayed true to our legendary family values.                
                We look forward to sharing this magic with you at our home.
